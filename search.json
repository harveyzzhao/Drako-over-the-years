    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\nBetween 2009 and 2018, I scraped all Drake lyrics available on Genius using the lyricsGenius library. The dataset, comprising over 500 songs, includes details such as song name, album, year of release, and complete lyrics.\nIn my exploratory analysis, I focused on the number of songs per album, yearly release trends, and word count distribution across Drake’s discography. Additionally, I identified songs with the highest and lowest word counts.\nIn my deeper analysis, I focused on calculating sentiment of individual Drake songs through 2 popular NLP libraries. I got an idea of negative, positive and neutral sentiment through exploring 3 songs in each category. Then, I computed 2 graphs - how Drake songs’ sentiment varies every year, and how earlier albums’ sentiments compare to later albums. Through some pattern recognition and digging of his life events, I found 4 distinct periods in Drake’s music career.\nHowever, the dataset presented challenges. While there are over 500 rows, only 221 have complete data. Missing information, mainly release dates and album names, was common, especially for singles. Given that singles are a critical aspect of modern music distribution, this posed a potential issue. Some songs might have been excluded due to missing release dates or album associations.\nThe scraping process itself was imperfect. Using an older version of lyricsgenius, I encountered issues like non-lyrical annotations (e.g., [Intro], ) embedded in the lyrics. With limited experience in advanced data cleaning, some noise, redundant characters, and annotations likely slipped through.\nCleaning the dataset was a challenging task. Out of the initial 500+ songs, I filtered out around 300 tracks that were duplicates, live versions, or diss tracks. Despite the simplicity of the API, the cleaning process demanded considerable effort to handle the noise and ensure data quality.\n\nGetting the dataset\n\n# scraping data\nfrom lyricsgenius import Genius\n\nTOKEN = \"REDACTED\"\ngenius = Genius(TOKEN)\ngenius.excluded_terms = [\"Remix\", \"Live\", \"Untitled\", \"u00e7e \", \"Separate LivesVer\", \"Mashup\", \"Freestyle\", \"Leak\",\n                      \"Diss\", \"Award\", \"Verse\", \"Dub\", \"Demo\", \"Awards\", \"Length\", \"Zin\", \"#\", \"version\", None]\nartist = genius.search_artist(\"Drake\", max_songs=1)\nlyrics = artist.save_lyrics()\n\n\n# create file paths + dataframe\nimport os\nimport glob\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\n\npath = './lyrics_files'\ndata_list = []\n\n# Read and process JSON files\nfor filename in glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*.json')):  # Only process .JSON files in the folder\n  with open(filename, encoding='utf-8', mode='r') as json_file:\n    data = json.load(json_file)\n    songs = data.get('songs', [])\n    for song in songs:\n      data_list.append({\n        'name': song.get('title'),\n        'album': song.get('album'),\n        'year': song.get('year'),\n        'lyrics': song.get('lyrics')\n      })\n\n# Create DataFrame\nlyrics_df = pd.DataFrame(data_list, columns=['name', 'album', 'year', 'lyrics'])\n\n\nNegative Song - I Do this\n\n\nNegative Song - I Do this\nHere were the first 10 rows of the raw scraped dataset:\n\nlyrics_df.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nalbum\nyear\nlyrics\n\n\n\n\n0\nGood Ones Go (Interlude)\nTake Care\n2011-11-15\n[Intro]\\nOh yeah\\nOh yeah, oh yeah, oh\\nOh yea...\n\n\n1\nKeep the Family Close\nViews\n2016-04-29\n[Intro]\\nIt's a little chilly out there\\nHow y...\n\n\n2\nUsing Me\nNone\nNone\nYeah\\n6 shit\\n\\nBeen with so many women I can’...\n\n\n3\nLight Up\nThank Me Later\n2010-06-15\n[Verse 1: Drake]\\nUh, I've been up for four da...\n\n\n4\nCatch No Feelings\nNone\nNone\n[Drake]\\nI told you from the jump, me and you ...\n\n\n5\nThese Days\nNone\n2016-03-29\n[Verse 1]\\nI've been out walking\\nI don't do t...\n\n\n6\nOverdose On Life\nNone\n2008-04-30\nAnd I'm a leave on one more note\\nOne more mot...\n\n\n7\nTalk Up\nScorpion\n2018-06-29\n[Intro: Drake]\\nDJ Paul\\nTWhy\\nAyy, ayy\\nLot o...\n\n\n8\nCannonball\nHeartbreak Drake\nNone\n[Chorus: Colin Munroe]\\nHow could I fly, but l...\n\n\n9\nThank You Note to 40\nNone\n2016-04-28\nBefore we do this I just wanna say thanks man....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are getting a lot of null values in album and year.

We are done with cleaning the data!\n\n\nHigh Level Overview of Dataset\nLet’s look at 5 details in our dataset to gauge what data we are dealing with. 1) How many songs did Drake release 2) Number of albums 3) Number of years Drake made a release 4) First and last year of songs in this table 5) Word count distribution of Drake’s songs\nYou can view the detailed code at https://github.com/harveyzzhao/DH140.\n\nDrake had 221 officially released songs and 22 albums in this dataset. Compared to other hip hop artists, Drake was one of the most productive.\nThis dataset spans 14 years from 2006 to 2019.\n\nDrake releases more than 5 songs most years up to 30+ songs in 2009. Hmm, he must have been really hardworking back then or something else is going on…\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nDrake on average has 500+ words per song. He had a mere 9 (!!!) words for his least verbose song, and 1122 words for his most verbose song (is he writing an essay??)\nHe was the most verbose in 2013, where he smashed his maximum word count record and did not drop below 500 words in one of his least verbose song. He visibly spiked his word count from 2013 to 2015. It just happened to be the 3 years before his most successful years in terms of new listener count, spotify streams and number of songs on billboard top 100.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nI was interested to see his most verbose songs and least verbose songs. Here is a breakdown of the top 5 most verbose and the top 5 least verbose songs.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\nFocused Analysis\nNow we have analyzed word count of Drake’s songs, and his productivity over the years, let’s dive into his song’s emotions.\nTo analyze Drake’s lyrics and identify distinct periods in his music career, we will follow a structured approach focusing on sentiment analysis, keyword analysis, and lexical diversity. #### sentiment analysis First, we will use ntlk to break each song’s lyrics into words and use ntlk’s opinion lexicon to get the sentiment of each word in lyrics. Then, we will add up the sentiment score of every word and compare all songs into a barchart. Then, we will model his 200+ songs with a trendline.\n\nHow to find distinct periods\nTo identify distinct periods, we will combine the results from sentiment analysis, keyword frequency, and lexical diversity into a single dataset. Using clustering algorithms like K-means, we will segment the songs into groups based on these features, revealing natural groupings that indicate different phases in Drake’s music career. Through these detailed analyses, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Drake’s sentiment has evolved over time.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis\nWe are using two different sentiment analyzers, VADER and nltk’s opinion lexicon to get a more unbiased opinion of Drake’s lyrics. First, we will use Vader’s sentiment analyzer to model the sentiment of Drake’s songs. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is designed for analyzing sentiment in social media texts. It combines a sentiment lexicon with rules to handle punctuation, capitalization, and intensity modifiers, making it effective for informal text analysis.\nWhy I chose Vader for sentiment analysis\nVADER is well-suited for analyzing Drake’s lyrics due to its adaptability to social media language, ability to capture nuances in sentiment, and straightforward implementation. It efficiently quantifies sentiment, handling elements like slang, emphasis, and intensity, which are common in song lyrics.\n\nimport nltk\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.sentiment import vader\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer\n\nnltk.download(\"stopwords\")\nnltk.download(\"vader_lexicon\")\n\n[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/harvey/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package vader_lexicon to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/harvey/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package vader_lexicon is already up-to-date!\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nstopwords_set = set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\nsentiment_analyzer = vader.SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"lyrics.csv\")\ndf['tokenized'] = df['lyrics'].apply(word_tokenize)\n\nsentiment_scores_vader = []\nfor tokens in df[\"tokenized\"]:\n  song_sentiment_score = sum([sentiment_analyzer.polarity_scores(token)[\"compound\"] for token in tokens])\n  sentiment_scores_vader.append(song_sentiment_score)\n\nplt.bar(list(range(len(df))), sentiment_scores_vader)\n\n&lt;BarContainer object of 221 artists&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph doesn’t make much sense. Each bar is very thin and we can’t easily see a pattern without having release date as the x axis. Let’s group each song’s sentiment by year of release and use a box plot to show distribution of each year’s sentiment.\n\ndf[\"sentiment_scores_vader\"] = sentiment_scores_vader\n\ndf_boxplot = df.groupby(\"year\")[\"sentiment_scores_vader\"].apply(list).reset_index(name=\"scores\")\n\n# Create a boxplot for each year's sentiment scores\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.boxplot(df_boxplot['scores'], labels=df_boxplot['year'])\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Sentiment Scores')\nplt.title('Boxplot of Sentiment Scores per Year')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can clearly see how sentiment roughly changes year by year. From 2006 to 2007, Drake kept his lyrics positive, with the most negative song being much more positive than the most negative quartile of songs in 2014. This stage also displayed quite a small variation, especially 2007 where the middle 50% of songs are the most similar in sentiment among all of his songs. To see what it means to be neutral in sentiment (0 sentiment score), positive (0-5), and negative (0 to -5), let’s pick 2 songs from each category.\n\n# Select 2 songs with neutral sentiment\nneutral_songs = df[(df['sentiment_scores_vader'] &lt;= 0.2) & (df[\"sentiment_scores_vader\"] &gt; -0.2)].sample(2)['name']\n\n# Select 2 songs with positive sentiment\npositive_songs = df[(df['sentiment_scores_vader'] &gt; 0.2) & (df['sentiment_scores_vader'] &lt;= 5)].sample(2)['name']\n\n# Select 2 songs with negative sentiment\nnegative_songs = df[(df['sentiment_scores_vader'] &lt;= 0.2) & (df['sentiment_scores_vader'] &gt;= -5)].sample(2)['name']\n\nprint(\"Neutral songs: \", neutral_songs.values)\nprint(\"Positive songs: \", positive_songs.values)\nprint(\"Negative songs: \", negative_songs.values)\n\nNeutral songs:  ['Marvin’s Room' 'November 18th']\nPositive songs:  ['Glow' 'Asthma Team']\nNegative songs:  ['Stunt Hard' 'Karaoke']\n\n\nWe choose Nothing Into Somethings as neutral song,* Hotline Bling* as positive song, and I Do This as negative song.\nThey have a score of 0.13, 4.56 and -1.78. Let’s investigate what each number means.\n\nprint(df.loc[df[\"name\"] == \"Nothings Into Somethings\"][\"sentiment_scores_vader\"])\n\nprint(df.loc[df[\"name\"] == \"Hotline Bling\"][\"sentiment_scores_vader\"])\n\nprint(df.loc[df[\"name\"] == \"I Do This\"][\"sentiment_scores_vader\"])\n\n52    0.1313\nName: sentiment_scores_vader, dtype: float64\n200    4.5687\nName: sentiment_scores_vader, dtype: float64\n3   -1.7778\nName: sentiment_scores_vader, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\nNeutral Song - Nothing Into Somethings analysis\n\n\nNothing into Something Lyrics Analysis\nDrake’s song “Nothing Into Somethings” is generally viewed as having a neutral to slightly negative connotation. The song deals with themes of reflection and the complexities of relationships and success.\nA sentiment score of near 0 means Drake did not mention any violence, suicidal or generally depressing topics. Drake simply told his personal issues - a failed relationship and the emotional toll it takes.\n\n\nNothing Into Somethings Lyrics:\nYou’ll hear some slow tracks, you know what I’m sayin’?\nWith, like, some pimpin’ to it, or somethin’\nThat you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin’?\nBig cup of Act’, I’m drowsy\nI’m still posted up where you first found me\nDid I just read that you just got engaged on me?\nI heard from your friend, you couldn’t even tell me\nOr better yet wait on me\nNah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah\nCan’t just leave it off that way Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah Sha-nah-nah-nah (nah)\nCan’t just leave it off that way, nah Least, do I get an invitation or something?\nA statement or something?\nAsk about that, you would say it was nothing\nBut here’s another nothing that you made into something\nCan’t just leave it off that way\n\n\nPositive Song - Hotline Bling Analysis\n“Hotline Bling” is positive because it combines Drake’s reflection on an ex-partner with an upbeating tone. Drake wrote playful lyrics and reminisced about the girl’s independent past. However, in the lyrics he wished nothing bad for the girl and wondered how she was now.\nMost importantly, Drake did not express his resentment towards his ex or insulted amnyone. Instead, he called his ex “my love”, and descrived good times Drake and his ex spent. I would qualify this song as a positive for sure.\n\n\nHotline Bling Lyrics\nYou used to call me on my\nYou used to, you used to\nYeah\nYou used to call me on my cell phone\nLate night when you need my love\nCall me on my cell phone\nLate night when you need my love\n\n\nNegative Song - I Do this Analysis\nI think this song is positive in that Drake is showing off his success and taunting other rappers. He mentioned that “the deal got signed” and “I’m a motherfuckin’ genius” to reveal his recent success. I think Vader categorized this song as negative because it’s not reading much context and weighed in filler words like “godammit”, “motherfuckin’” and “shit”. I propose we filter out these common rap filter words to get a more accurate representation of Drake song’s sentiment.\n\n\nI Do This Lyrics\n[Verse 1: Drake] Uh, shit’s all good\nThe deal got signed, and my split’s all good\nAnd these haters pretending that it’s all good\nSay that shit in person man, I wish y’all would\nI’m a motherfuckin’ genius, goddammit\nI ain’t the type to murder you, I’m more the type to plan it\nSo please take a seat if you really can’t stand it\nGot success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic\nBut Belly told me to do me\nAnd don’t listen to anybody that knew me\n’Cause to have known me would mean that there’s a new me\nAnd if you think I’ve changed, then the slightest could have fooled me\nYeah, and to my city I’m the 2-3\nDrug dealers live vicariously through me\nNo bench time, nickname’s “Starter Drake”\nFranchise player, I don’t even get a water break\nAnd these other niggas is hardly mentioned\nI bet that with this pen, I could draw attention\nBut you could tell by my strut\nI’m just chillin’ in the cut, nigga what, and I’m feelin’ like\n[Chorus: Drake & Belly] I get it, I get it, I get it ’til I’m done\nTell them rappers I’m the man in the city that I run\nSo you holla at me pimpin’ if you plannin’ on a visit\nAnd they say that you can talk it when you live it …\n\n\nApplying Filter and recompute sentiment\n\n# List of common rap song filler words\nfiller_words = [\n    'fuck', 'fuckin', 'shit', 'motherfuckin', 'motherfucking', \n    'yo', 'uh', 'yeah', 'uh-huh', 'uh-uh', 'what', 'c\\'mon', \n    'let\\'s go', 'hey', 'ha', 'whoa', 'alright', 'okay', 'holla', \n    'check it', 'now', 'right', 'ayy', 'nah', 'mmm', 'word', \n    'you know', 'know what I\\'m sayin\\'', 'feel me', 'for real', \n    'no doubt', 'it\\'s like', 'you dig', 'that\\'s right', 'true', \n    'believe that', 'straight up'\n]\n\nstemmer = PorterStemmer()\ndf['stemmed_tokens'] = df['tokenized'].apply(lambda lyrics: [stemmer.stem(word) for word in lyrics])\nstemmed_filler_words = [stemmer.stem(filler_word) for filler_word in filler_words]\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has a 'lyrics' column where each cell is a list of words\ndf['filtered_tokens'] = df['stemmed_tokens'].apply(lambda lyrics: [word for word in lyrics if word not in filler_words and word not in stemmed_filler_words])\n\n\nsentiment_scores_vader = []\nfor tokens in df[\"filtered_tokens\"]:\n  song_sentiment_score = sum([sentiment_analyzer.polarity_scores(token)[\"compound\"] for token in tokens])\n  sentiment_scores_vader.append(song_sentiment_score)\n\nplt.bar(list(range(len(df))), sentiment_scores_vader)\n\n&lt;BarContainer object of 221 artists&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[\"sentiment_scores_vader\"] = sentiment_scores_vader\n\ndf_boxplot = df.groupby(\"year\")[\"sentiment_scores_vader\"].apply(list).reset_index(name=\"scores\")\n\n# Create a boxplot for each year's sentiment scores\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nplt.boxplot(df_boxplot['scores'], labels=df_boxplot['year'])\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Sentiment Scores')\nplt.title('Boxplot of Sentiment Scores per Year')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, Drake’s songs are getting significantly more positive.

We can balance VADER’s overtuning towards short, expressive content if we add in the opinion lexicon for comparison.\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import opinion_lexicon\nnltk.download(\"opinion_lexicon\")\npositive_words = set(opinion_lexicon.positive())\nnegative_words = set(opinion_lexicon.negative())\n\n[nltk_data] Downloading package opinion_lexicon to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/harvey/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package opinion_lexicon is already up-to-date!\n\n\n\n\n\nsentiment\n\n\n\n\n\nsentiment distribution by year\n\n\nWe have roughly the same trend but majority of years have a smaller variance than that of vader’s sentiment analyzer.\n\n\n\nyearly trend lexicon\n\n\nThis definitely has a smoother curve than the one compiled with Vader. We still see the same pattern however: very positive sentiment in 2016 album Views, very negative sentiment in 2009 album So Far Gone and less positive sentiment from 2014’s Young Money: Rise Of An Empire to 2015’s NBA 2k16 Soundtrack.\nWe can also see a good upward trend from 2009’s So Far Gone - EP to 2013’s Nothing was the Same. This period could mark a steady career progression for Drake."

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nSentiment Scores Over Albums (Ordered by Year)\nThe sentiment scores in Drake’s albums show significant fluctuations over time, with notable spikes and dips that may correlate with events in his life and career.\nFor instance, Drake’s debut mixtape, “Room for Improvement” (2006), has a high sentiment score, possibly reflecting his early optimism and ambition as an emerging artist. Conversely, there’s a significant drop in sentiment for “Heartbreak Drake” (2009), which might indicate a period of introspection or emotional turmoil reflected in his lyrics.\nAnother significant spike occurs with the release of “Views” (2016), an album that marked a high point in Drake’s commercial success. The optimistic and nostalgic themes of this album could explain the heightened sentiment score.\nHowever, “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” (2015) shows a drop in sentiment score, potentially due to its darker themes and the aggressive tone that marked a shift in Drake’s musical style during that period.\n ### Boxplot of Sentiment Scores per Year Analyzing the sentiment scores by year, we can observe distinct patterns. Between 2006 and 2010, the sentiment scores remain relatively stable, without extreme highs or lows. This period likely represents Drake’s early career as he found his footing in the music industry.\nFrom 2011 to 2013, there’s increased variability in sentiment scores, particularly in 2012, where both high and low outliers are observed. This period might reflect Drake’s experimentation with different themes and styles, possibly influenced by the pressures of growing fame and personal experiences.\nThe years 2014 to 2016 show a wider range in sentiment scores, with 2016 standing out due to a significant spike. This might correspond to the emotional diversity in his lyrics during the release of “Views,” an album that explored themes of success, nostalgia, and reflection.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the sentiment scores appear to stabilize, with fewer extreme outliers. This could indicate a period where Drake, having reached a certain level of maturity and success, took a more measured and consistent approach to his lyrics. \n\n\nBig Picture\nThe sentiment analysis of Drake’s lyrics over the years reveals a clear evolution in his music, reflecting key moments in both his personal life and professional career. The data suggests that changes in the tone of his lyrics align with significant milestones, indicating that these shifts are not random but deeply connected to his experiences.\n\n\nFindings\nI group Drake’s music evolution in 4 distinct periods:\n\nEarly Career (2006-2010)\nDuring the early years of Drake’s career, his music is marked by higher sentiment scores, likely reflecting the optimism and ambition of a new artist breaking into the industry. The sentiment remains relatively stable during this period, indicating that Drake was focused on establishing his identity and style.\n\n\nTurbulence (2011-2013)\nAs Drake’s fame grew, his music began to show greater emotional variability. This period is marked by a wider range of sentiment, suggesting that the pressures of success and personal challenges were beginning to influence his lyrical content. The variability in sentiment scores indicates a phase of experimentation and deeper exploration of complex themes.\n\n\nPeak Fame (2014-2016)\nA significant spike in sentiment, particularly with the release of “Views” in 2016, coincides with a peak in Drake’s commercial success. This period marks a transition in his music, where themes of nostalgia, reflection, and the complexities of fame become more prominent. The heightened sentiment score reflects a period of introspection and self-reflection in his lyrics.\n\n\nMaturing (2017-2019)\nIn the later years, sentiment scores begin to stabilize, suggesting that Drake has found a more consistent and mature approach to his music. The reduced variability in sentiment indicates that he has achieved a balance in his artistic expression, focusing on themes that resonate with his established audience.\n\n\n\nHow could you find my analysis useful\nThese insights are valuable for understanding the trajectory of Drake’s career and the thematic shifts in his music. For industry professionals, this analysis can inform marketing strategies by pinpointing periods in Drake’s career that resonate most with different audience segments. For fans, it provides a deeper understanding of how Drake’s life events have influenced his music, offering a richer connection to his work.\nOverall, the sentiment analysis illustrates how Drake’s music serves as a reflection of his personal and professional journey, offering a lens through which to view his evolution as an artist."
