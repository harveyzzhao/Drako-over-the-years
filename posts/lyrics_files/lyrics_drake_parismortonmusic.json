I wish you could still accept me for me\nI miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad\nThe simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have\nI\u2019m halfway across the world with dozens of bags\nFeeling like all four members of Color Me Badd\nIn one nigga, amazing shit\nI got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit\nI don\u2019t drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit\nAnd I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit\nWhich one of y\u2019all got fleets on your keychains? The seats for these Heat games?\nI really think that you stare at yourself and you see things\nLa Familia, I\u2019ve been inducted and instructed\nTo stunt on these niggas we don\u2019t really fuck with, fuck is up?\nHaving lunch and debating Ferrari prices\n23 and going through a midlife crisis\nBut trust me, I still deliver like a midwife\nAnd no, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m the nicest, I just live life like it\nUh, it take a certain type of man to teach\nTo be far from hood, but to understand the streets\nI never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech\nBecause I haven\u2019t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach\nYeah, you gotta own it if you want it\nKisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment\nAnd, baby, I\u2019ll never forget none of that\nGirl, I told you I was coming back\n\n[Hook]\nWould've came back for you\nI just needed time to do what I had to do\nCaught in the life, I can't let it go\nWhether that's right, I will never know\n\n[Interlude]\nHope you will forgive me, never meant wrong\nTried to be patient, waited too long\nBut I would've came back, but I would've came back for you\nWould've came back, would've came back", "image": "https://images.genius.com/771fefed17b139d917bcba4f9723462a.329x400x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
