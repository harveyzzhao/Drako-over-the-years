(We bag jackin, bitches!)\nTake your whole bag of candy, leave you in the cold\nSo bring the ruckus if you under 12 years old\n\n[Jay Pharaoh]\nIt's 7:58 and now your curfew is pushin\nWatch how just like Republicans I'm behind the bushes\n\"It wasn't me\" - if you asked me, that's what I'mma tell ya\nAnd I'mma eat so much chocolate, my blood type's Nutella\nGot wanted signs from madd parents, state troopers\nKidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch-slapped an Oompa-Loompa\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Drake]\nGive me your Reese's Pieces, give me your Hershey bars\nI want your Milky Way, give me that Snickers bar\nI would Trick-or-Treat but I'm too old now\nSo I snatch your bag so I don't look like a pedophile\nMy sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me\nWe're talking stomach aches, restraining orders, cavities\nI probably won't have no teeth when I'm finished\nI don't pay for the porcelains, I just marry my dentist\n\n[Hook]", "image": "https://images.genius.com/22999a3378819809ee4848f7c60a744c.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Drake"}
