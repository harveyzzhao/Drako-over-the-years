When it's all over?\"\nShe asked me\n\"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?\"\nI don't wanna think about that right now\nHeat of the moment\nHeat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment\nI ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one I'm on it\nThe last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it\nCan't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment\n\n[Interlude]\nWhat are we even doing?\n\n[Verse 2]\nRidin' clean\nWith you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things\nYes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord\nI've seen some things\nI wish we had met when I was in my teens\nYes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord\nCause these days I only know conditional love\nI'm not used to settlin' down\nI'm too used to switchin' it up, oh\nAnd she says, \"you don't how good it is to be you cause you're him\"\nAnd I say \"well, goddamn\"\n\n[Hook 2]\nThen ask myself\nWho am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?\nWho am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?\nI don't wanna think about that right now\nHeat of the moment\nHeat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment\nI ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one I'm on it\nThe last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it\nCan't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment\n\n[Outro: Dennis Graham (& Drake)]\nAll of this, it\u2019s alcohol, it\u2019s drugs, weed, it\u2019s everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need uh,uh, uh, uh to educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot\n\n(Yeah, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted\u2026)\n\nThey know they\u2019re too hot. They don\u2019t give a fuck. It\u2019s the Heat Of The Moment. It\u2019s the Heat Of The Moment and that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s The Heat Of The Moment\n\n(I agree.)\n\nThis shit, that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom\n\n(Haaa.)", "image": "https://images.rapgenius.com/c29bfdfd5a903c38a56b5b174115ec1b.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Drake"}
